     Given I am on the ctshirts home page
     When I click login
     And I login as "testmail@123.com" using password "pass1234"
     And I go to the product page
     And I add the current product to the basket
     And I go to the basket page
     And I click checkout
     Then it should be tracked as a Other page
     And the debug info should show no SMART-recs
