     Given I am on the virginwines home page
     When I click login
     And I login as "webtest@mailinator.com" using password "webtest"
     And I go to the product page
     And I add the current product to the basket
     And I go to the basket page
     And I click checkout
     Then it should be tracked as a Checkout page
     And the debug info should show no SMART-recs
